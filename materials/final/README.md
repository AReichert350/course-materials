**Adeline Reichert  
Black Hat Go Final Project  
May 6, 2022**

Each directory contains a main.go file with instructions at the top for how to run.

The project is based on the Abusing Databases portion of Chapter 7 of Black Hat Go.  
The directories implement:
1. Establishing Go connections to Mongo, MySQL, Postgres, and MSSQL databases.
2. Database schema miners for Mongo, MySQL, Postgres, and MSSQL databases.
3. A singular user interface for running the database miners for Mongo, MySQL, Postgres, and MSSQL databases.
