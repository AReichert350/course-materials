I selected Options 1 and 2 for this lab.

For Option 1, I implemented API call functionality for the /shodan/query endpoint. 
I created a new file, query.go, in this /shodan directory. 
I additionally had to modify main/main.go in order to be able to run calls to this new endpoint.

For Option 2, I followed the Lab 3b video and implemented the display-additional-page extension to host.go.
I additionally integrated this functionality for the /query endpoint as well.
I modified shodan/host.go and main/main.go to implement this extension.
