**What the code does:**
- Scans ports in a specified range of a specified address and for each port prints whether it is open or closed. Defaults are ports 1-1024 for the address "scanme.nmap.org".

**Modification to the code:**
- Uses DialTimeout to only spend 1 second to attempt to connect to each port (TODO 2)
- Reports which ports are closed (TODO 3)
- Is somewhat-optimized with a nice number of parallel threads (TODO 4)
- Output is in csv format (TODO 5)
- Returns the number of closed ports and the number of open ports (TODO 6)

**Details of #5 extension:**
- Can pass in a slice of port numbers which will all be scanned
- Can pass in a specific address to scan the ports of
- Returns a map of the format map[port-number]open-or-closed for each of the scanned ports

From initial README: You might need to do a "go mod init bhg-scanner" or "go mod tidy"
